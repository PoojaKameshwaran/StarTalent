StarTalent is a Talent Management DBMS Solution that helps Talent Agencies manage their data efficiently. The entertainment industry has countless short-term jobs across various verticals and clients or rather, 
artists need to be employed in a short span of time. Agencies have multiple clients, agents and companies they collaborate with to provide clients with jobs. Agents represent clients to different companies and 
appeal to the interest of these studios or production powerhouses. So, there are complex relationships between these 3 players. The solution was implemented in MySQL Server / Workbench as part of SQL Implementation efforts and in MongoDB as the NoSQL equivalent.

The StarTalent Repository was created to record the process of Database Design, Definition and Management of StarTalent. Below mentioned are the steps in the process.

1. Project Proposal - Summarizes the need for StarTalent, the business requirements and expectations of StarTalent
2. Conceptual Model - Includes the EER & UML Models that outline all of the Entities and their relationships
3. Relational Model - Translates the EER Model to the Relational Model and contains all of the relations that will eventually help in the DB Design
4. Logical Model - Includes 2 SQL Scrips : CreationDDL which defines all of the tables / relations in the Relational Model and InsertionDDL includes sample data to populate the DB
5. Application connection - Includes the Jupyter Notebook that connects MySQL to Python to execute queries and draw conclusions with various charts such as Bar chart, pie chart etc.
6. NoSQL Implementation - Includes a report of all of the data loaded into MongoDB and execution of Aggregation and Map Reduce functions to perform joins and complex operations.
